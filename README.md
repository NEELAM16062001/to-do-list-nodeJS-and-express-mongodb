# to-do-list-nodeJS-and-express-mongodb
The app will be built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Users will be able to create to-do lists, where they can add list of tasks. The tasks created by users will be stored in the database. Under each list, users can add "cards," which are items in a list. Users can add a due date, a checklist, and labels to each card.
